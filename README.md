# Movie Battle

This is a new project, a longer description coming soon!

## The Gist
This is a frontend react app that's meant to connect to an express/socket.io server. 
The server handles all the data, api calls and game logic, and the front end updates based on the data provided in each callback.
The front end displays information in a progressive manner, cycling through menus and game responses based on what is and isn't featured in the data.
The result is interactive, real-time gameplay that is unfazed by accidental refreshes or connectivity issues.
